        <ul class="listExperience">
          <li class="year">2024
            <ul>
              <li><b>Lenovo</b></li>
              <li>* Product development (server module, OpenBMC web GUI).</li>
              <li>* CI/CD process planning and implementation</li>
              <li>* Automation system (daily build/commit build)</li>
              <li>* Test management (smoke/AB/integration/unit testing)</li>
              <li>* Email trigger test automation service</li>
              <li>* OpenBMC (build environment/test automation)</li>
              <li>* Leadership</li>
              <li>* After graduating from graduate school, I joined Lenovo Technology immediately. 
                This department primarily develops server products. 
                Our team is responsible for developing power and airflow modules. 
                My specific responsibilities within the team include：
                - Setting up CI/CD processes
                - Planning tests
                - Developing a web GUI (OpenBMC)
                - Assisting and enhancing the testing team's expertise            
                In addition, I also built an automated system for the company. 
                This system receives notifications when product builds are complete, 
                then triggers testing and sends reports to relevant personnel. 
                The notification mechanism uses a specially designed email approach, 
                which is user-friendly even for those without a development background.                  
                During my time at the company, 
                I self-improved and developed various automation technologies 
                and related tools (such as Jenkins, Gerrit, Git, Harbor, Docker, Apollo system, etc.). 
                Introducing these tools to the team required time and skill enhancement. 
                As a result, I organized educational training sessions and workshops, 
                advocating for Agile methodology within the company. 
                Leading these efforts helped team members enhance their professional abilities 
                and apply their knowledge to assist colleagues. 
                These experiences have become valuable assets for my next job and have solidified my career direction.</li>

                <li>* Product Development (PAD、Clean robot)</li>
                <li>* Driver porting (accelerometer, RTC, gyro, etc.)</li>
                <li>* CI process design and creation</li>
                <li>* After joining MSI (Micro-Star International), I worked on product development for 
                      - tablets 
                      - robotic vacuum cleaners. 
                      My primary responsibilities involved driver functionality 
                      (gyro, proximity, and accelerometer sensors). 
                      In addition to development tasks, I also honed my testing skills. 
                      Testing is an essential part of the development process, 
                      and having robust testing procedures in place ensures smoother development. 
                      Later, I even set up a CI (Continuous Integration) automated workflow system to accelerate 
                      the collaboration between development and testing.</li>
