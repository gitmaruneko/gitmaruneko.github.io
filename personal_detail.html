      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <h2>工作經歷</h2>
      <ul class="listExperience">
        <li class="year">2024 April - 2018
          <ul>            
              <li><b>Lenovo</bb></li>
              <li>* After graduating from graduate school, I joined Lenovo Technology immediately. 
                    This department primarily develops server products. 
                    Our team is responsible for developing power and airflow modules. 
                    My specific responsibilities within the team include：
                    - Setting up CI/CD processes
                    - Planning tests
                    - Developing a web GUI (OpenBMC)
                    - Assisting and enhancing the testing team's expertise            
                    In addition, I also built an automated system for the company. 
                    This system receives notifications when product builds are complete, 
                    then triggers testing and sends reports to relevant personnel. 
                    The notification mechanism uses a specially designed email approach, 
                    which is user-friendly even for those without a development background.                  
                    During my time at the company, 
                    I self-improved and developed various automation technologies 
                    and related tools (such as Jenkins, Gerrit, Git, Harbor, Docker, Apollo system, etc.). 
                    Introducing these tools to the team required time and skill enhancement. 
                    As a result, I organized educational training sessions and workshops, 
                    advocating for Agile methodology within the company. 
                    Leading these efforts helped team members enhance their professional abilities 
                    and apply their knowledge to assist colleagues. 
                    These experiences have become valuable assets for my next job and have solidified my career direction.</li>

              <li><b>Micro-Star International Co. Ltd.</b></li>
              <li>* After joining MSI (Micro-Star International), I worked on product development for 
                    - tablets 
                    - robotic vacuum cleaners. 
                    My primary responsibilities involved driver functionality 
                    (gyro, proximity, and accelerometer sensors). 
                    In addition to development tasks, I also honed my testing skills. 
                    Testing is an essential part of the development process, 
                    and having robust testing procedures in place ensures smoother development. 
                    Later, I even set up a CI (Continuous Integration) automated workflow system to accelerate 
                    the collaboration between development and testing.</li>

            <li>* During my tenure at Pegatron, my responsibilities included building up the product board 
                  (Set-Top Box、TV、PAD), 
                  TV UI designing and implementing maintain, and Android support (HDMI, App remote control).

                  - Tablet computer (Panasonic)                
                  Television products constituted the majority of my work, 
                  where I primarily focused on GUI development, picture quality adjustments, 
                  and driver post-processing. Later, I also worked on tablet products. 
                  At that time, Android system was in its early stages, and I developed apps using the Eclipse tool. 
                  I integrated the entire stack from the underlying layers to the application layer 
                  to achieve HDMI projection to the television. 
                  All of these products, whether tablets, set-top boxes, or televisions, 
                  were based on the Linux system, which provided me with a solid understanding of Linux.</li>

                  The system used was Windows Mobile. My responsibilities included collaborating with Qualcomm 
                  engineers to address system issues and developing features related to DirectShow.</li>
